    '''Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, and later became one of the most famous physicists in history. Known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation," he significantly contributed to modern physics theories. Besides his scientific achievements, Einstein had a passion for music, particularly loving the violin. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, primarily for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, rather than his relativity theories. Einstein also held outspoken political views, advocating for civil rights and socialism, and was a member of the NAACP. He expressed concerns about the rise of fascism in Europe in the 1930s. Einstein also enjoyed sailing and was known for not being very good at it. He moved to the United States in the early 1930s, where he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He died there in 1955.
